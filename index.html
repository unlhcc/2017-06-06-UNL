<p>
  <a href="http://hcc.unl.edu">HCC</a> presents the <a href="https://events.unl.edu/HCC_Events/2017/06/06/120609/">June Workshop Series</a> event which is scheduled for each Tuesday afternoon in June.  The first two modules (occuring June 6th and 13th) will cover the basics of the Unix Shell, and Git using the traditional Software Carpentry lessons. More information (including a schedule and links to the lessons) is provided below.
</p> 

<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including unix shell programming, and version control.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
